# Space Tourism Website

[The live site](https://stwebsite.netlify.app/)

## Why is it (site) existing?

Hello!:wave:
I am **Danylo Sushko**. I am **_Front-End React Developer_**.
I'm looking for a **job** so I wanted to create **something** which can shows what I know.:cowboy_hat_face:

## What is the project

I found a design (with images and a figma file) of the project on [Front-End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3/hub).
I wanted to show my knowledge in libraries with React and how they work with Class components.

## What have I used?

I have created the **_Space Tourism Site_ **on **React** class components with some **libraries**.
I have used:

1. **JSX** (Class Components).
2. **SCSS/SASS** (for animations on destination pages).
3. **Framer Motion** (for animations on a technology page and a burger menu).
4. Connected **Redux** for my burger menu.
5. Main rules of **responsive design**.
6. Connect **React-Router**.

Thank **you** for reading my **_README_**! :sunglasses::call_me_hand::thumbsup:
